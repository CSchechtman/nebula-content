## Activity: Building a Navigation Bar and a Photo Gallery

**Objective**: Apply Flexbox concepts to create a responsive navigation bar and a photo gallery.

**Tasks**:
1. **Create a Navigation Bar**:
    - Develop a horizontal navigation bar with links. Use **`display: flex;`** to layout the links.
    - Apply **`justify-content`** to space out the links and **`align-items`** for vertical alignment.
2. **Design a Photo Gallery**:
    - Arrange a series of images in a gallery layout. Utilize **`flex-wrap`** to allow the gallery to adapt to different screen sizes.
    - Use **`flex-grow`** to ensure that the images take up the available space evenly.

**Expected Outcomes**:
- A fully responsive navigation bar that adjusts to the screen size.
- A photo gallery showcasing a flexible, wrap-around layout.
