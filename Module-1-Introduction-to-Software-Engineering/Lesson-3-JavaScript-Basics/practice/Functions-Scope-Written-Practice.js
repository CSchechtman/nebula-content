// Answer the following questions in your own words
// 1. What is a function?
// it's a user-defined mini-program that can be called and used repeatedly in your program
    
// 2. Why is it useful?
//you can use it over and over and input different variables each time 

// 3. Give a 'real world example'. Ours was wood chipper. Try and think of something yourself. 
// a crock-pot - ingredients go in, cook, food comes out
        
// 4. There is different syntax / ways of defining a function write out the syntax for each:
// // A. Function declaration:

// // B. Function expressions:
 
// // C. Arrow functions: 

// 5. What is a parameter?
// it's the input to the function - placeholder variable that whenever we pass in value to our function, is referenced by the function

// 6. What is an argument?
// it's what's saved to the parameter, it fits into the parameter -- when you call the function, you define the input
  
// 7. What does the return statement do?
// it tells the function to output the product of the function
    
// 8. What is scope? Do you have a real-world example of something similar to scope?
// scope determines which variables are active in each part of the code
